# Corda Façades

[MAYBE ADD SOMETHING ABOUT HOW CORDA FACADES ARE DIFFERENT TO GENERIC FACADE TERM USED IN PROGRAMMING?]

The Façade API acts as a bridge, facilitating seamless and secure communication between distinct CorDapps. It enables
them to interact and exchange data while maintaining a clear separation of concerns. The Façade serves as a common
interface definition, abstracting away the implementation details from the underlying CorDapps.
By incorporating Façade Proxy objects alongside other Corda APIs, developers can leverage the power of Interoperability
while maintaining a consistent and familiar development experience.
